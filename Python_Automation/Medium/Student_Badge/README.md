## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes a student name and grade level as input. Print a badge that repeats the first letter of the student’s name as many times as the grade level, followed by the full name. Handle cases where the grade level is zero or negative by displaying an appropriate message.

## Sample Data

**Normal case:**

* name = "Alice"
* grade = 3

**Edge case:**

* name = "Bob"
* grade = 0

## Sample Input/Output

**Normal Case:**

```python
Enter student name: Alice
Enter grade level: 3
Badge: AAAlice
```

**Edge Case:**

```python
Enter student name: Bob
Enter grade level: 0
Invalid grade level. Cannot create badge.
```

## Learning Objective

Practice string operations (concatenation and repetition), input handling, basic validation, and conditional statements.

## Allowed Libraries

None

## Task Type

String manipulation, input validation, conditionals
