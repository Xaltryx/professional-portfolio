## Problem Statement
Write a program that asks the user for the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. Calculate total pay, display it, and also show the data types of both inputs and the result.

## Sample Data:

Normal case: hours = 40, rate = 15

Edge case: hours = 0, rate = 0

## Sample Input/Output:

```yaml
Enter hours worked: 40
Enter hourly rate: 15
Total pay: 600
Type of hours: <class 'int'>
Type of rate: <class 'int'>
Type of total pay: <class 'int'>
```

```yaml
Enter hours worked: 0
Enter hourly rate: 0
Total pay: 0
Type of hours: <class 'int'>
Type of rate: <class 'int'>
Type of total pay: <class 'int'>
```

## Learning Objective
Practice variables, input conversion, arithmetic operators, type checking, and print statements.
