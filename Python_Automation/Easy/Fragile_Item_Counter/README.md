## Problem Statement

Write a program that counts how many items are marked `"fragile"` in a list.

## Sample Data

`["fragile", "standard", "fragile", "heavy", "standard", "fragile"]`

## Expected Output

```python
Fragile count: 3
```

**Edge Case (empty list):**

```python
Fragile count: 0
```

## Learning Objective

Practice variable updating (`count = count + 1`) and using a `for` loop for definite iteration.

## Task Type

Data structure + counting pattern
