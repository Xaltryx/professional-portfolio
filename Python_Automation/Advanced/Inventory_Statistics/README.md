## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes a list of item quantities (integers) and calculates the following:

* Total items received
* Average quantity per item
* Maximum quantity
* Minimum quantity

Handle empty lists and lists with duplicate quantities. Use meaningful variable names and comments.

## Sample Data

**Normal case:**
`quantities = [12, 7, 9, 15, 8, 10, 7, 11, 14, 9]`

**Edge case:**
`quantities = []`

## Sample Input/Output

**Normal Case:**

```python
Quantities: [12, 7, 9, 15, 8, 10, 7, 11, 14, 9]
Total items: 102
Average quantity: 10.2
Maximum quantity: 15
Minimum quantity: 7
```

**Edge Case:**

```python
Quantities: []
No items received. Cannot calculate statistics.
```

## Learning Objective

Practice lists, loops or built-in list functions, arithmetic operations, conditional handling for empty data, meaningful variable names, and comments.

## Allowed Libraries

None

## Task Type

Data structures, computation, validation, modular code
